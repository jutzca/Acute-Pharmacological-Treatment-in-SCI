"Complications arising from acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) are routinely managed by various pharmacological interventions.
Despite decades of clinical application, the potential impact on neurological recovery has been largely overlooked. The goal of this
study was to highlight drugs with potential disease modifying effects, and, in doing so, identify a novel translational path to enhancing
function for individuals with acute injury.
Nearly every individual sustaining spinal cord injury receives multiple types and classes of medications to manage a litany of problems
associated with traumatic spinal cord injury. We performed an analysis of available clinical trial and observational data to determine
what constitutes standards of acute pharmacological care after traumatic spinal cord injury. The goal of this study was to determine
the types of medications commonly administered, alone or in combination, in the acute phase of spinal cord injury. To this end, we conducted
an analysis of available clinical trial and observational data to determine what constitutes standards of acute pharmacological care
after spinal cord injury. Concomitant medication use (i.e., non-randomized medications), including dosage, timing and reason for administration,
was tracked through the duration of the trial and observational study. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the medications administered
within the first 90 days after spinal cord injury. R Statistical Software was used for all statistical analyses and to create plots for data visualization.
Over 770 unique medications were administered within the first month after injury. On average, patients received 20 unique medications (range 1-58) â€“
often in a combinatorial or overlapping fashion (i.e., polypharmacy). Approximately 10% of medications were administered acutely as prophylaxis
(e.g., pain, infections).Our study revealed a high degree of polypharmacy in the acute stages of spinal cord injury, with potential to both positively and negatively impact neurological recovery.",
